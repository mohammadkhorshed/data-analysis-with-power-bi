# IBM HR Analytics â€“ Employee Attrition Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my **Data Analysis with Power BI** practice, focusing on the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset.  
The main objective is to explore the factors contributing to employee attrition and present the findings through interactive dashboards.

Currently, the analysis covers **categorical features vs. attrition**.  
In future updates, I will add a second dashboard focusing on **numerical features vs. attrition**.
